<h1>Grant Proposal</h1>
September 5, 2022
Loot MMO has submitted a grant proposal to Gitcoin's 15th funding round! <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/6419/loot-mmo" target="_blank">Support us</a> with your cryptovote! Gitcoin uses a <i>quadratic funding</i> approach, which means any donations from the public, even as low as $1, go a long way in generating matching amounts from the total pool of funds. The number of people contributing is more important than their amounts:

<h1>Wield your loot. Live your lore.</h1>
LootMMO is a massive, persistent fantasy RPG where adventures are created by the Loot community.

With an early-access version of the game already published and playable, LootMMO features:<ul><li>Action-RPG gameplay.
</li><li>An online social hub to connect everyone's adventures.
</li><li>Character classes that bring life to Loot bags (More Loot, Genesis and others supported).</li><li>Open source framework and tools designed by veteran game devs, for creating MMO content.</li><li>Game jams and community events to fill the Loot world with immersive adventures, created and curated by the community.</li></ul>We believe in the future of collaborative worldbuilding. LootMMO is created by Loot holders and fans, as well as many independent Lootverse projects. Back this project to support onboarding more dev teams, more prize pools for upcoming game jams, and hands-on training for Loot community members.

<div class="caption">8 character classes: Sorcerer, Rogue, Paladin, Ranger, Healer, Warlock, Fighter and Shaman.</div>
<h1>GR-15 Update: Characters, Quests, and Tankards of Beer</h1>
Thanks to the incredible support of the Loot community, in GR14 we raised over $7,000 from more than 90 people to bring LootMMO to life. We’re back with an update on our progress in the last two months.<ul><li>Grown from a solo project to a team of 6 contributors.</li><li>Designed 8 playable character classes, each with 5 abilities.</li><li>Fully implemented all 18 Loot weapons.</li><li>Completed and published the social hub, including activities such as a poker table, pinball and a functional tavern.</li><li>Designed a quest system with an initial set of 15 quests, to onboard players and serve as examples for community builders.</li><li>Open sourced <a href="https://github.com/standardcombo/LootMMO" target="_blank">the project</a> and published our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcyWCNTFqRiR6TIK2Z8w7F829iAAOZ7K5ycAhcx_4TE/" target="_blank">design docs</a>.</li></ul>The LootMMO team has grown from a solo project to a team of 6 contributors. We host community meetings every two weeks to discuss design, art, and lore, which we then turn into detailed public design docs and playable gameplay components.

Our next phase is to release these tools and gameplay components to the public and empower them to create the fantasy content they’ve always wanted. That’s where this crowdfund comes in.

<div class="caption">Character selection screen. Different Loot collections are valid for equipping your character: Loot, More Loot and Genesis Adventurers are thus far integrated.</div>
<h1>Framework</h1>
The framework is an open-source construction kit, a set of gameplay building blocks that can be combined, modified or expanded to craft any number of experiences. This includes, but is not limited to:<ul><li>NPCs & combat
</li><li>Weapons, armor, abilities
</li><li>Inventory
</li><li>Progression
</li><li>Procedurally generated levels
</li><li>Integration with various collections: Loot, More Loot, Genesis Adventurers and Crypts and Caverns (more to come).</li></ul>
<img src="Screenshots/2_hub.png" alt="Social Hub" width="100%">
<div class="caption">The social hub connects adventurers and quests, and can host special events.</div>
<h1>Social Hub</h1>
A starting point for Loot MMO, the social hub has been designed as a cozy space where players and builders can meet, discuss Loot and form parties to head off on adventures. Doors, maps and other interactive objects double as connection points── portals into the experiences created by the community. Where this "home base" evolves will be up to everyone to decide from here.

<div class="caption">The tavern is a sub-section of the social hub where players can prepare and serve drinks, complete with chair-throwing brawls. Pictured here are also the nameplate badges, indicating how many tokens players own from each collection.</div>
<h1>Community Engagement</h1>
Loot MMO comes to life by engaging the community in building the world. These programs have the added value of reactivating lapsed Loot-folk and beyond, by attracting external game devs, to Loot.

<b>Game jams</b>
These limited-time events, generally lasting a few weeks, are a proven way to incentivize world-building. The first game jam will occur soon after receipt of funding, as well as version 1.0 of the framework. The prize pool will be announced at the start of the jam, along with different submission categories. These categories help prompt the creative process and serve as criteria for judging submissions and selecting the winners.

<b>Bootcamp</b>
A two-week course for any creator who wants to learn how to build with the LootMMO framework. In the Bootcamp folks will learn about 3D environments, real-time multiplayer, game development tools and more. Free to enter, limited slots.

<b>Bounties</b>
As the project encounters specific needs, bounties can be announced as challenges to the community, with a specified reward for each challenge.

<b>Content events</b>
Promoting the launch of new content, or special spins on existing content are great ways to keep players engaged while celebrating the community creators. These events have the effect of attracting outside players, bringing fresh eyes to the Lootverse.

<h1>About the Author</h1>
My name is Gabriel, a.k.a. standardcombo. I'm a full-time game developer, with 18 years of experience in the industry and 19 published titles. My currently active indie project is Stone Story RPG, an ASCII-animated dark world, full of monsters and mysteries. I enjoy playing highly competitive games, such as Starcraft, Chess and Hearthstone.

As a founding engineer at Manticore, I have full understanding and confidence in Core's capabilities. Core is a free-to-play (and free to create) open platform dedicated to empowering creators. Loot struck me immediately, not only as a stand-out project in web3, but as a perfect use-case for Core, to bring Loot to life as a MMORPG. Core benefits from the development of this MMO framework, as it can be reused for other projects and help grow Core's ecosystem. Manticore is more than happy to create a high-fidelity foundation for Loot, deploying our tech and skills to advance the Lootverse in the best ways that we know how.

<div class="caption">What started as an experiment in lighting became a high-quality tileset. Core contains tools designed for rapid development of multiplayer 3D games, built on top of the Unreal Engine. This scene is a tileset of 3D blocks that can be quickly rearranged to achieve different level designs. Both the tileset and level were created from scratch in about 4 hours by a single developer.</div>
<h1>Grant and Funds</h1>
Funds will be allocated for game jam rewards and bounties to generate content for the Loot MMO. The size of the grant directly affects the amount of content that can be incentivized this way.

In the event of minimal funding, we commit to organizing at least one game jam where grant funds return to the community in the form of prizes, followed by related community events that promote the new content.

Stretch goals: Ideally, the Loot MMO will continuously expand with more content and better systems. Based on learnings from the first game jam and the first generation of content, a version 2.0 of the framework will be produced, followed by more rounds of community events. Other stretch goals include bounties and engaging contractors to fill project needs. To sustain Loot MMO over the longer term, the launch of a new NFT collection (potentially in conjunction with a DAO) could provide recurring revenue and is an important stretch goal.

Remaining or residual funds will be directed at related activity, such as gas costs in deploying contracts, testing, URLs/hosting and other such expenses.
