	The Main scene contains the Bag selection screen as well as the Social Hub.
	
	
	Fade Layer
	==========
	A top-level UI that obstructs the entire screen. This is what allows the game to
	fade in from black when starting up.
	To edit the scene, toggle visibility of the Fade Layer. The Fade Layer can be found
	in the "Top-Level UI" folder in the Hierarchy.

	See the FadeLayer script for more info.
